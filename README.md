# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository inlcuded some starter back-end code which I built upon to practice my HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and my Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills. 

- This project includes addition animation effects for an enhanced user interface and active button scrolling.
